Title: Spatial Regression With Bayesian Estimation in STAN for Labour-Force Participation in India: an Introduction and Tutorial

We provided the webinar on 17 Oct. 2022 (Eventbrite https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/spatial-and-poisson-models-of-risk-of-events-a-methods-webinar-tickets-439488561117?utm-campaign=social&utm-content=attendeeshare&utm-medium=discovery&utm-term=listing&utm-source=cp&aff=escb) 

The files include:
--   two sets of 40 Powerpoint slides
--   one Tutorial guide, providing some sketchy answers to the set tasks
--   one background case-study (PDF) about spatial regression via Bayesian MCMC modelling methods, led by Dr. Diego Perez Ruiz
--   Figures, code, dataset for ages 15-24 in India 2017/8 and 2018/9
--   Full code for cleaning the India data yourself to study any other aspect of Indian society using 'Periodic Labour-Force Survey' 2017/8 or 2018/9.
Use all these for self-managed learning. 

We are ready to take your questions via email. 

In all, this set of materials might take up to three hours to read through at a rapid or superficial level. In the powerpoint slides, there are 2 options
For a typical social scientist or social demographer, it could take 6 weeks at 10 hours a week to learn to use R for programming STAN to apply these methods.
It may be easier if you use R's brms package or lme4 to do simpler models first. 
These might be multilevel models with a spatial level j.
BEGINNERS' NOTE: For those without any programming background...a separate tutorial in 2018 helped by providing two powerpoint slidesets - that repository is HelpBayesianStatisticsTutorial2018.   - Wendy Olsen
