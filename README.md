Bayesian statistics for social scientists, a four-part Introduction with Exercises

These four helpful files on Introductory Bayesian social statistics include:
   one Exercises document,
   one background 2-page Poster in powerpoint (PDF) about Bayesian modelling methods, and
   two sets of 40 Powerpoint slides.
Use all these for self-managed learning. Or hold a workshop and learn together!



In all, this set of materials might take up to three hours to read through at a rapid or superficial level. In the powerpoint slides, there are 2 options
1) start at basics of defining child labour; then
2) start using regression models. 
We provide more detail on your learning time inputs for each objective.
For a typical UK based social scientist, it may take 6 weeks at 10 hours a week to learn to model child labour risk factors using these methods. It will take less if your mathematics is very good, or more if you are not familiar with data-processing software (such as SPSS, Stata, or R). And, for those without any programming background... this tutorial with two powerpoint slide packs can help you get started:-  it really works! - Wendy Olsen
